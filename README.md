# What is this all about?

This is a brief tutorial to undergraduate students major in Ecology, especially in SLS, PKU. Trying to answer: 1)what they must know before hands on experiments or analysis; 2)what are the most commonly used paradigms; 3)where to get help if they want to go into some specific questions. 

# Happy to have a chat with you!

This repo is still under construction. 

I don't have any experience in writing such a long document before, and English is not my native language. So if you find anything that is stupid or doesn't make sense, or you want to join me writing this tutorial together, or you have some suggestions, please don't hesitate to send me an email(lily_wang@pku.edu.cn)! I am grateful for all suggestions, ideas and criticisms.
